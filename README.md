# scammer-buster-form-blaster
Initial Code was designed by Engeneerman. Improved by me. Designed to bombard scammers forms that phish for information.

I use this to flood phishing websites with useless data so they have to sift through thousands of usernames/emails and passwords.

# Changelog
V. 2 (coming soon)
- Auto-detect POST url
- Auto-Detect Form Fields
- Ability to select to populate form field with either JSON file or Random Text
